# Stock-Analysis
Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, we aren’t adding new functionality; we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be the entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
